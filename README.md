**Overview**

Any new parent or friends/family of a new parent will have asked the question "Who does the child look like? Mom or Dad?" Sometimes this provides a good debate, but it's hard to get an objective answer. This webapp was created to end the debate.

The user clicks on the circle icon to upload a picture or activate the mobile camera to snap a picture. Then the image is compressed & resized and uploaded to be analyzed using Microsoft's Facial Recognition AI. 27 data points are used and compared against mom/child and dad/child. The confidence match is returned and compared to declare the winner. 

App can be viewed in portrait mode. When rotated to landscape mode, the view is automatically scaled to better fill the view (for desktop use).

*Please note, the uploaded image is kept anonymous and deleted by Microsoft within 24 hours.
